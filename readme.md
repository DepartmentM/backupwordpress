## Issue Tracking

All tickets for the project are being tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/humanmade/backupwordpress/issues). You can also take a
look at the [recent updates](https://dev/bwp.hmn.md) for the project.

## Security

We take the security of BackUpWordPress extremely seriously. If you think you've found
a security issue with the plugin (whether information disclosure, privilege
escalation, or another issue), we'd appreciate responsible disclosure as soon as
possible.

To report a security issue, you can either email `backupwordpress@hmn.md`, or
[file an issue on HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/backupwordpress/). We will attempt to give an initial
response to security issues within 48 hours at most, however keep in mind that
the team is distributed across various timezones, and delays may occur as we
discuss internally.

(Please note: For testing, you should install a copy of the project and
WordPress on your own server. **Do not test on servers you do not own.**)
